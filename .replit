echo \"The Zephyr Base Node requires a full Zephyr RTOS environment to build. To build it, you would need to:

1. Install Zephyr SDK and dependencies
2. Initialize Zephyr workspace with west
3. Build with command: west build -b rpi_pico zephyr_base_node/app

For complete instructions, please refer to the Zephyr Getting Started Guide:
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html

The zephyr_base_node directory contains all the necessary code ready to build
once you have set up a proper Zephyr development environment.\""""
